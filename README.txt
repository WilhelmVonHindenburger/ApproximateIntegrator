  This program is a calculator that does
approximate integration. The function integrated,
the end points, which of five methods of
approximate integration to use (Left-hand rule,
Right-hand rule, Midpoint rule, Trapezoid rule,
and Simpson's rule), and how many divisions to
split the integrated region into.

  This program only runs on GNU/Linux systems
that have the GNU C++ compiler run with "g++". It
can be adapted for other systems but the system()
commands at the end must be changed to whatever
commands are used to run the compiler and the
compiled calc.cpp program.

  This program requires a calc.cpp file that it
will write to. If one does not exist, it should
create one itself.
